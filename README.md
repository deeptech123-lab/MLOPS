# Sample Frontend Web App

A tiny, dependency-free frontend sample that showcases a responsive layout, theme toggle, and a few interactive UI widgets.

## Getting started

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then visit <http://localhost:8080>.

## Features

- Responsive hero + feature cards layout
- Light/dark theme toggle (stored in `localStorage`)
- Fake stats that animate on load
- Newsletter form with basic validation
